                    <h3>The Power Combo</h3>
                    <p>Don't play a card just because you can. Saving cards allows you to build a powerful push. A classic combination is placing a high-HP "tank" unit (like a Golem) in front, followed by a high-damage, low-HP unit (like an Archer) behind it. The tank absorbs damage while the archer safely attacks.</p>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h3>Lane Overwhelm</h3>
                    <p>Focusing all your pressure on a single lane can be highly effective. By deploying multiple units in the same lane over several turns, you can overwhelm your opponent's defenses, forcing them to spend all their resources on one side while you prepare for a final, decisive attack.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h3>The Long Game</h3>
                    <p>If your opponent is aggressive, sometimes the best strategy is a strong defense. Use your cards to efficiently counter their attacks. Your goal is not to destroy their Kingdom quickly, but to survive the 60 turns and win by having more Kingdom HP at the end of the game. Every point of health matters!</p>
                </div>
                 <div class="rule-card">
                    <h3>Resource Denial</h3>
                    <p>Force your opponent to react to your moves. By playing a card they must respond to, you dictate the flow of the game. This can cause them to use their cards inefficiently, preventing them from saving up for the powerful combinations they might be planning.</p>
