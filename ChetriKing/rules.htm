                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h3>The Objective</h3>
                    <p>Your goal is to protect your Kingdom (which has 10 Health Points) while simultaneously attacking and destroying your opponent's Kingdom before the 60-turn limit is reached.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h3>The Battlefield</h3>
                    <p>The game is played on a path consisting of 8 tiles that separate the two opposing Kingdoms. Your units will march across these tiles to reach the enemy.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h3>The Cards</h3>
                    <p>You command units like Archers and Knights by playing their cards. Each card has unique Health (HP) and Attack Power, determining their strength in battle.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Winning the Game</h4>
                    <p>You win by reducing the enemy Kingdom's HP to 0. If 60 turns pass, the player with the most Kingdom HP wins. If HP is tied, the game is a draw.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Turns & Actions</h4>
                    <p>Each turn, you draw one card and may play one card by placing it on the first tile in a lane. You can also choose to save your card to build powerful combinations.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="rule-card">
                    <h4>Card Health</h4>
                    <p>A card's health is tracked by its physical rotation. An 8 HP Golem will turn 8 times before being defeated. An Archer with 2 HP will turn twice and then be removed from play.</p>

                <h2>Gameplay Flow</h2>
                <p class="section-subhead">A typical turn in Chetri King follows a simple sequence.</p>
                
                <ol class="flow-list">
                    <li>
                        <h3>1. Draw Phase</h3>
                        <p>At the start of your turn, you draw one card from your deck, adding it to your hand.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>2. Action Phase</h3>
                        <p>You may take one action: either play a card from your hand onto an open starting tile, or choose to do nothing and save your cards for a later turn.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>3. Movement Phase</h3>
                        <p>All of your units already on the battlefield advance one tile forward toward the enemy Kingdom.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>4. Combat Phase</h3>
                        <p>If one of your units moves onto a tile occupied by an enemy unit, they fight. If your unit reaches the final tile and is unblocked, it attacks the enemy Kingdom, reducing its HP.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
